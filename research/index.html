<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, my current research interests are studying high-dimensional math problems, mainly at the interface of probability, combinatorics, and information theory. Specifically, my research interests include:</p>
<p>Combinatorics and Coding Theory</p>
<p>Boolean functions and Hamming spaces</p>
<p>Packing and covering</p>
<p>Probability and Information Theory</p>
<p>Common information, noise stability, isoperimetry, and hypercontractivity</p>
<p>Coupling and optimal transport</p>
<p>Information-theoretic methods, especially the combination of entropy/divergence and coupling techniques</p>
<p>Past Interests: My research has seamlessly transitioned from video transmission to current ones.</p>
<p>(Thank my former advisors for providing me freedom to choose topics.)</p>
